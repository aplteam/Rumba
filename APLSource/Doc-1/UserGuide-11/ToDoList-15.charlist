# To Do

## Implement Rate-Limiting

Look at X-RateLimit-Remaining, Retry-After, etc. Look at maximum requests per some time period. For
example, on each request, have we seen this IP before? If so, increment request count by 1, then
check against max, elapsed time, reset, etc.

## Implement SSE: Server-Sent Events

Server-Sent events...

## Write user guide topic for the Client.
