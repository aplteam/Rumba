# Tests Namespace

The Tests namespace contains the test suite for Rumba. Each test is a function that must return 1
for fail, or 0 for pass. The name of each function should start with "Test". The right argument of
a test function is not used. The left argument of a test function is optional, and should default
to zero. It should be used to set the various session logging properties like LogCongaEvents and LogMessages

A test function should throw no output to the session other than what occurs as a result of setting
logging properties to 1.

A test function can assume that the Rumba test server is up,  running and listening for requests.

Test functions should need no additional resources and make no assumptions about other installed
software. They may only assume the Rumba Test Server to be up on the same machine.

The test functions are not individually documented.
