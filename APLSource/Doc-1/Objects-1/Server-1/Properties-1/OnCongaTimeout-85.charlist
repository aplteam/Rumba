Server{.info}

The OnCongaTimeout property specifies a call back function to be called at every server timeout.
This function is expected to exist in the namespace or object instance defined by the →[Context]
property. This callback may be the name of a method of some class.

The right argument to the function is the →[##.##.Server] object provided by the server. The result
of the callback should be 0.
